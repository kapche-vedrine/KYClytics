I need you to FIX these issues (do not simulate—make them actually work):

Refresh redirects to Login:
When I refresh on a protected page, it always goes back to /login. Fix session persistence by storing the JWT (and optionally user info) in localStorage, rehydrating auth state on app load, attaching token via Axios interceptor, and keeping the user on the same route after refresh. If token is missing/expired then redirect to login and after login return to the previous page.

Client report PDF is blank:
Downloading a client report creates a PDF but it opens empty. Implement a real PDF generator endpoint GET /api/clients/:id/report.pdf that fetches the client from Prisma and writes all client details (name, dob, address, country, job, industry, pep, riskScore, riskBand, nextReviewDate), plus document list and latest score breakdown. Return with correct headers: Content-Type: application/pdf and Content-Disposition: attachment. Use PDFKit (or equivalent) and stream the PDF response. Update frontend download to use responseType: "blob" and trigger a proper file download.

Uploaded documents can’t be downloaded:
Upload works, but download only “simulates”. Implement a real download endpoint GET /api/clients/:id/documents/:docId/download that serves the actual stored file with res.download() / safe streaming, verifying clientId ownership and file exists. On frontend, download using Axios responseType: "blob" and save the file.

New clients are not persisted:
When I create a new client, it must be saved in the database and appear after reopening the app. Ensure POST /api/clients actually writes using Prisma and returns the created record. Ensure dashboard uses GET /api/clients from DB (not hardcoded state). After creating a client, invalidate/refetch React Query ["clients"]. Confirm Prisma uses a persistent SQLite file like file:./dev.db (not in-memory). Seed data should still work.

Deliverables:

Update the backend routes, middleware (auth/RBAC), and Prisma calls.

Update frontend auth handling, route guards, Axios config, and file download code.

Provide any code diffs and instructions to run/migrate/seed if needed.
